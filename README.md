# Introduction

You will need to install Node.js, and run "npm install" in both the client and server directories. Once that is done, you can run the client build like this:

```bash
cd client
npm start
```

and

```bash
cd server
npm start
```

At this point you can access the UI from http://localhost:3000.

## Deployment

See the first video for an example of me deploying this to a DigitalOcean server. I haven't written up the instructions yet.
